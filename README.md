I recently completed a QA Engineer bootcamp at TripleTen, where I developed skills in:

- Analyzing requirements and designs
- Developing test cases and bug reports in Jira
- Manual and automated testing
- API testing with Postman
- Web and mobile testing

My background in medicine has shaped my analytical approach and commitment to uncovering root causes, which I now apply in Quality Assurance to ensure optimal solutions and software reliability.
