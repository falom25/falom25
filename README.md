I recently completed a QA Engineer bootcamp at TripleTen, where I gained hands-on experience in:

- Analyzing requirements and designs
- Developing test cases and bug reports in Jira
- Manual and automated testing
- API testing with Postman
- Web and mobile testing

My background in medicine has refined my analytical skills and focus on root causes, which I apply in Quality Assurance to ensure robust solutions and software reliability.

## Skills

- Manual and UI Testing
- Postman
- PostgreSQL
- Android Studio

- Git/GitHub
- JIRA

## Currently

- Strengthening my QA knowledge
- Expanding my expertise to contribute to projects where precision and quality are crucial
